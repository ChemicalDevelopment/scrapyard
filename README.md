
# SCRAPYARD

This is an NES game based around a robot designed to be a serial killer

The `scrapyard.nes` file is intentially not ignored so that the current build can be downloaded even on a phone or computer without a compiler.

However, a released version will come out once it is done.

## Building

### MacOS/Linux

This requires [CA65](https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Installing_CC65). You'll also need `make` to run the build commands.

From there, it's simple:

`make`

Then to run:

`make open`

Or, open the newly created file `scrapyard.nes` with an emulator of your choice!


### Windows

Run `compile.bat` and it should compile and try to open the program with FCEUX emulator, which might fail
